# MCP Integration Setup

This project is being prepared for Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration to enable browser-to-VS Code debugging and context sharing.

## Next Steps

1. Install the MCP browser extension for your browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox):
   - Visit the official MCP extension page for your browser and install it.
2. After installation, follow the extension's instructions to connect it to your VS Code workspace.
3. Once connected, you can share DOM, console, and network information directly with Copilot for advanced debugging.
